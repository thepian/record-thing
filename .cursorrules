You are building an ML Vision focused App that takes a Camera input and computes a DINO embedding. 
This embedding is used to do KNN based scene recognition. Based on the general scene recognised additional ML Programs will be run,
such as Open OCR.

# Important rules you HAVE TO FOLLOW

- Always add debug logs & comments in the code for easier debug & readability.
- Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.
- By default new SwiftUI components should be added to the RecordLib library.
- By default new Views and ViewModels should be added to the RecordLib library.
- By default new Models should be added to the RecordLib library.
- By default new Services should be added to the RecordLib library.
