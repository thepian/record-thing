## **5. User Stories**

- **Object Recording**:  
  *As a user, I want to scan my belongings effortlessly so that I can maintain a record for insurance purposes.*  
- **Recognition & Avoiding Duplicates**:  
  *As a user, I want the app to recognize previously recorded items to prevent duplicates.*  
- **Document Association**:  
  *As a user, I want to attach receipts and warranties to my recorded objects for proof of purchase.*  
- **Event Logging**:  
  *As a user, I want to record incidents (damage, maintenance) linked to my belongings.*  
- **Data Sync & Backup**:  
  *As a user, I want my records stored safely in the cloud so I donâ€™t lose my data.*  
- **Showcase my Purchase**
  *As a user, I want to help showing my new purchase to my friends and family.*

### **5.A. Object Recording**

  *As a user, I want to scan my belongings effortlessly so that I can maintain a record for insurance purposes.*

  I will hold the object in front of the camera, and the app will automatically capture multiple angles. The app will associate the images with metadata such as descriptions, prices, and categories. The app will group related images of the same object and suggest the type of recordings that should be made by the user.

### **5.F. Showcase my Purchase**

  *As a user, I want to help showing my new purchase to my friends and family.*

  I will record the packaging, subject and related documents. The app will construct a showcase video and page that I can share with my friends and family.
  I will earn points for creating it for the first time for a specific product or model, and for sharing it with friends and family.

  The showcase recording requires; A barcode, a purchase/sales receipt, a photo of the packaging back/sides with information(company name, product name, model name, SKU, shop sticker, website, Product Manual QR code), a photo of packaging front,
  a hero shot of the unpackaged product placed on a surface, a 360 video of the held/standing product, a hero shot in context(where used).
