   - Test on different device screens

4. **Color Implementation**
   - Define primary color
   - Define accent color (complementary)

   ```

   **Variation Prompts:**
   ```
   "Design an app icon featuring a stylized camera and checklist, using turquoise as the primary color. The design should be simple yet distinctive, suitable for both iOS and macOS."
