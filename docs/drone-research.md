# Drone research

Drone combat strategy is rapidly developing. 
Jamming and drone-to-drone attacks are becoming more common.
Which are the current low cost loitering surveillance drones.
Create a market overview and future directions.

Consider,

- What are the leading combat drone product development companies?
- Types of jamming, passive and active measures against jamming 
- Drone-to-drone attacks, types of attacks and how to defend against them
- The area coverage of a surveillance drone, operation height, speed, duration, payload, etc.
- Types of drone radio used in combat drones
- What drones would European armies need in 5 years


## Jamming

Jamming is a technique used to disrupt the communication between drones. 
It can be done in different ways, such as:

- Radio frequency jamming
- GPS jamming
- 


# Communication types

The EAV-4 and Zephyr S drones operate at a height of 20 km. 
They can communicate with Smartphones on the ground using something termed D2D.
Research what the term means and the range of options.
What options are there in terms of wireless communication for drones operating at 10 km and 1 km altitudes.
How is the airspace restricted for drones at different altitudes.
What communication options are there for small commercial and custom drones.
How can tethered drones work with a range of many kilometers.
Make a research report.
