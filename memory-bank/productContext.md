# Product Context: Record Thing

## Why This Project Exists

Record Thing was created to solve the problem of documenting and organizing physical possessions in a reliable, secure, and intelligent way. In today's world, people own numerous valuable items but lack effective tools to:

1. **Document ownership** with proper evidence
2. **Prove authenticity** of valuable items
3. **Organize collections** of physical possessions
4. **Share information** about items with others (insurance companies, buyers, etc.)
5. **Request verification** of items from other users

Traditional methods of documenting possessions (photos, spreadsheets, paper receipts) are fragmented, insecure, and don't leverage modern computer vision and machine learning capabilities.

## Problems It Solves

### For Individual Users

- **Evidence Management**: Centralized storage for receipts, photos, and documentation of valuable items
- **Item Recognition**: Automatic identification of items using computer vision
- **Organization**: Structured categorization of possessions
- **Proof of Ownership**: Verifiable records for insurance claims or resale
- **Secure Sharing**: Controlled sharing of item information with selected parties

### For Communities

- **Verification Requests**: Request evidence about items from other users
- **Community Showcases**: Share collections with like-minded enthusiasts
- **Trust Building**: Establish provenance and authenticity for collectibles
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Learn about similar items from the community

### For Businesses

- **Insurance Documentation**: Streamlined process for documenting insured items
- **Authentication Services**: Verification of high-value items
- **Inventory Management**: Tracking of business assets

## How It Should Work

### Core User Flow

1. **Record**: User captures photos/videos of an item using the app
2. **Recognize**: The app uses ML to identify the item and suggest metadata
3. **Organize**: The item is categorized and stored in the user's collection
4. **Evidence**: User adds additional evidence (receipts, certificates, etc.)
5. **Manage**: User can view, edit, share, or request information about items

### Key Components

- **Camera Interface**: Simple, guided photography of items
- **ML Recognition**: Automatic identification using DINO v2 and other models
- **Evidence Repository**: Secure storage for all item-related documentation
- **Request System**: Interface for requesting evidence from others
- **Sync System**: Cross-device synchronization via secure cloud storage
