# Active Context: Record Thing

## Current Work Focus

The current development focus is on building the core functionality of the Record Thing application, with emphasis on:

1. **ML Vision Integration**: Implementing DINO v2 for scene recognition and object identification
2. **Evidence Management**: Building the UI and backend for recording and organizing evidence
3. **Database Schema**: Finalizing and implementing the SQLite schema with vector extensions
4. **Cross-Platform UI**: Ensuring consistent experience across iOS and macOS

## Recent Changes

### ML Integration

- Integrated MLX framework for optimized ML processing on Apple Silicon
- Implemented DINO v2 model for image feature extraction
- Added KNN-based scene recognition for categorizing captured images

### UI Development

- Created ThingsView and ThingsHeaderView components for displaying user items
- Implemented RequestsView and RequestsHeaderView for managing evidence requests
- Developed cross-platform navigation system that works on both iOS and macOS

### Database Implementation

- Finalized SQLite schema with tables for Things, Evidence, Requests, and Accounts
- Added vector extensions for similarity search
- Implemented Blackbird ORM integration for Swift access to the database

### Backend Tools

- Created Python CLI for database management (init-db, update-db, populate-db)
- Implemented synchronization utilities for B2/Bunny CDN integration
- Added sample data generation for testing and development

## Next Steps

### Short-Term (1-2 Weeks)

1. Complete the camera interface for capturing evidence
2. Implement basic ML recognition pipeline
3. Finalize the Things and Evidence relationship in the UI
4. Add initial sync functionality between devices

### Medium-Term (1-2 Months)

1. Implement the complete Request system for evidence sharing
2. Enhance ML recognition with additional models
3. Add user authentication with Passkeys
4. Develop community showcase features

### Long-Term (3+ Months)

1. Expand to Android platform
2. Implement advanced ML features (receipt OCR, document analysis)
3. Add community features for sharing and verification
4. Develop analytics and reporting capabilities

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

- **Database Vector Extensions**: Evaluating performance impact of vector similarity search in SQLite
- **ML Model Size vs. Accuracy**: Balancing model size and accuracy for on-device processing
- **Sync Strategy**: Determining optimal approach for multi-device synchronization
- **Cross-Platform UI**: Deciding on component structure for maximum code reuse

### UX Considerations

- **Camera Guidance**: How to guide users to capture optimal photos for ML processing
- **Organization System**: Best approach for categorizing and displaying user items
- **Evidence Presentation**: How to present evidence in a clear and verifiable manner
- **Request Flow**: Designing the flow for requesting and providing evidence

### Open Questions

1. Should we implement a federated learning approach for improving ML models over time?
2. How do we handle very large collections with potentially thousands of items?
3. What's the best approach for handling sensitive information in evidence records?
4. How can we optimize the sync process for users with limited bandwidth?

## Current Challenges

1. **ML Processing Speed**: Optimizing on-device ML processing for real-time feedback
2. **Database Performance**: Ensuring efficient queries for large collections
3. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Maintaining consistent UX across iOS and macOS
4. **Sync Reliability**: Handling edge cases in synchronization process

## Recent Feedback

- Users want more guidance during the item recording process
- ML recognition accuracy needs improvement for certain item categories
- Database queries are slow for large collections
- UI navigation could be more intuitive on macOS
