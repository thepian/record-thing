### Team Focus

- **UI/UX Team**: Building camera interface and evidence workflow
- **ML Team**: Optimizing recognition pipeline and model performance
- **Backend Team**: Implementing sync functionality and database optimizations
- **QA Team**: Testing core functionality and identifying issues

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues

1. **ML Performance**: Scene recognition is slower than desired on older devices
2. **Database Queries**: Some queries are inefficient for large collections
3. **UI Responsiveness**: Camera preview causes frame drops on certain devices
4. **Sync Conflicts**: Edge cases in multi-device synchronization not fully handled

### UX Issues

1. **Camera Guidance**: Users need better guidance for optimal photo capture
2. **Organization**: Current categorization system is not intuitive for all users
3. **Navigation**: Some users find the macOS navigation confusing
4. **Feedback**: Limited feedback during ML processing operations

### Platform-Specific Issues

1. **iOS**: Camera permissions handling needs improvement
2. **macOS**: Window management for multiple evidence items is clunky
3. **Cross-Platform**: Some UI components don't adapt well between platforms

## Next Priorities

1. Complete the camera interface for capturing evidence
2. Implement the basic ML recognition pipeline
3. Finalize the Things and Evidence relationship in the UI
4. Add initial sync functionality between devices
5. Improve database query performance for large collections

## Recent Progress (Last 2 Weeks)

- Implemented ThingsView and RequestsView components
- Added basic navigation system for iOS and macOS
- Integrated DINO v2 model with MLX framework
- Created Python CLI tools for database management
- Fixed several UI responsiveness issues on iOS
