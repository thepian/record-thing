Outline the structure for implementing an SQLite database to capture product and ownership of personal items. The schema is kept as SQL files and SQLModel/SQLAlchemy classes are define for ensuring type safety when querying and modifying. The classes will not create the database, but will be used to interact with the database. The database will be created using the `sqlite3` module in Python and SQL statement files.
It would include standard upc/asin/elid, product attributes, categories and information, including images, scraped from the Web. It would enable the users to add their own information and pictures. It would save hashes and vector embedding for public and private pictures of the products. Record identifies will be globally unique and generated using `ksuid().encode` from `cyksuid.v2`. Records are namespaced with an account ID named `account`, which is part of the primary key.
For image embeddings DINOv2 is used. For file hashing SHA1 is used.
Image embeddings are saved in sqlite-vec tables.
