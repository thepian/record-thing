# Logging in Swift View Components

> let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.thepia.toytown", category: "ui")

1. Privacy First: Despite the ease of logging, always ensure you're not capturing sensitive or personal user input.

2. Subsystems and Categories: Segment your logs using different subsystems (e.g., data, UI, network) and categories for better organization.

3. Consistent Naming: Adopt a uniform naming convention for your loggers, making it easier to filter and analyze logs.

4. Adaptive Logging: Use different log levels depending on the build (e.g., more verbose logging in debug builds and minimal in-release builds).

5. Incorporate Metadata: Logger supports metadata, allowing you to add supplementary context to your logs, enriching them for better diagnostics.
