## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### ‚ùå App Not Launching
```
Problem: RecordThing doesn't appear in simulator
Solution: 
1. Build app: xcodebuild -project RecordThing.xcodeproj -scheme "RecordThing iOS" -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16"
2. Install: xcrun simctl install SIMULATOR_UUID path/to/RecordThing.app
3. Launch: xcrun simctl launch SIMULATOR_UUID com.thepia.recordthing
```

#### ‚ùå Navigation Not Working
```
Problem: Buttons don't respond or navigation fails
Solution:
1. Check if app is in expected state
2. Verify button coordinates match current UI
3. Restart app and try again
4. Check for UI blocking elements
```

#### ‚ùå Content Missing
```
Problem: Expected UI elements not visible
Solution:
1. Verify app is built with latest changes
2. Check if view has loaded completely
3. Scroll if content is below fold
4. Verify simulator screen size matches expectations
```

#### ‚ùå Tests Timing Out
```
Problem: Tests fail due to timeouts
Solution:
1. Increase timeout values in test configuration
2. Add delays between navigation steps
3. Check simulator performance
4. Verify app responsiveness
```

## üìä Test Results Interpretation

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ All navigation flows complete successfully
- ‚úÖ All expected UI elements present
- ‚úÖ No crashes or freezes during testing
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior across test runs

### Failure Indicators
- ‚ùå Navigation gets stuck or fails
- ‚ùå Missing UI elements or incorrect content
- ‚ùå App crashes during navigation
- ‚ùå Inconsistent behavior between runs

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Navigation Speed**: < 1 second per transition
- **App Launch**: < 3 seconds to camera view
- **Memory Usage**: Stable during test execution
- **CPU Usage**: No excessive spikes during navigation

## üîÑ Maintenance

### When to Update Tests

1. **UI Changes**: Button positions, new screens, layout modifications
2. **Navigation Changes**: New flows, removed screens, altered user journeys
3. **Content Updates**: New sections, modified text, additional features
4. **Performance Requirements**: New timing expectations, resource constraints

### Updating Test Coordinates

When UI elements move, update coordinates in:
- `run_e2e_tests.py` - Python test runner
- `test_runner.sh` - Shell script runner
- Manual test instructions in this guide

### Adding New Test Scenarios

1. **Identify User Journey**: What new flow needs testing?
2. **Define Test Steps**: Break down into specific actions
3. **Implement Test**: Add to appropriate test runner
4. **Document**: Update this guide with new scenario
5. **Validate**: Run new test to ensure it works

## üìà CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Tests run automatically on:
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Monitoring Test Health

- **Success Rate**: Aim for >95% pass rate
- **Execution Time**: Monitor for performance regressions
- **Failure Patterns**: Identify recurring issues
- **Coverage**: Ensure all critical flows tested

## üéØ Best Practices

### Test Design
- **Atomic Tests**: Each test validates one specific flow
- **Independent**: Tests don't depend on each other
- **Repeatable**: Same results every time
- **Fast**: Complete test suite runs in <5 minutes

### Maintenance
- **Regular Updates**: Keep tests current with app changes
- **Documentation**: Update guides when tests change
- **Monitoring**: Watch for flaky or failing tests
- **Cleanup**: Remove obsolete tests for removed features

### Debugging
- **Screenshots**: Capture state on failures
- **Logs**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Isolation**: Run individual tests to isolate issues
- **Verification**: Manual verification of automated test results
