## Apple Device Support

With PyTorch it is easiest to run using the Apple MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) framework. The MPS framework is available on Apple devices with the M1 chip. The MPS framework is not available on Intel-based Macs.

For on device inference in production we would want to use Apple MLX (Machine Learning eXchange) framework. The MLX framework is available on Apple devices with the M1 chip. The MLX framework is not available on Intel-based Macs.
